# Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I’m Rahul V H, a curious and driven builder who enjoys turning ideas into working software and systems. I focus on developing practical, real-world solutions across web, machine learning, and embedded/IoT domains, learning by building and experimenting continuously. My projects are developed end-to-end using an AI-first workflow—fully leveraging AI as a co-developer (Vibe Coder) to design, implement, debug, and iterate faster while deeply understanding the underlying concepts. I use this space to document my learning journey, ship experiments, and evolve as a developer through consistent hands-on creation.
